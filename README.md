# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).
There are many TinyApps like it, but this one is mine.

TinyApp was developed as a project during my time at the Lighthouse Labs WebDev Bootcamp.

I took the time to go above and beyond the req'd specs for this project, implementing stretch goals such as using method override, tracking the date a short URL was created, and how many visits and unique visitors each shortURL has received.

Scroll to the bottom for some screenshots of the app in use.
